# CNC-axle_conversion
 Converts and scales G-code for Tampere UAS's CNC-mill.

The code was made for Tampere Formula Student personel as they had issues with cnc-postscript. The milling machine is modified and the original post-scripts woun't work any more. The right way to solve this problem is to write a new post script but at the time the code was made this was the fastest and easiest option.

The code and UI is written in Finnish at the moment but will be translated to English. Also the machine model and the original problem will be updated.
